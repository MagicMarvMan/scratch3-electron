# scratch3-electron
This is the new **Scratch 3** editor packaged into an Electron application.
If you have any problems with **Scratch 3** itself, consider opening an issue at [their repository](https://github.com/LLK).

All Copy- and License rights go to **Scratch 3**. I've only wrote an Electron wrapper around it.
